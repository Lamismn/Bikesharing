# Bikesharing
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize & study trends & patterns of a bike sharing application to determine if starting a similar project of the town of Des Moins - Iowa is a good idea
### Background
This study uses the bike sharing rides data from a bike sharing application in the city of New York. The data used covers the rides' number, duration & locations as well as the riders' gender, age & user type (subscriber or one time user) during the month of August 2019.
The study uses Tableau Public to visualize different patterns & trends as well as compare data of different genders, age demograpghics & user types.
## Results
Using Tableau public allowed us to visualize different trends & create a story that covers different sides of the project, 
a detailed analysis with a story can be found in this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lamis3656/viz/NYCCitiBikeStory_16226928631730/NYCBikesharing

The summary of results & visualizations are as follows:
1. Gender Patterns comaprison:

<img width="828" alt="Checkout times" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79733383/120586201-14541c00-c401-11eb-98cc-d30c718483c8.PNG">
<img width="779" alt="Trips by Gender by hr" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79733383/120586214-1d44ed80-c401-11eb-994e-9c2d437e19b0.PNG">

Studying the images above shows that there aren't much difference in gender patterns in bike utilization, while Males have a higher no. of rides than females, we can see that the patterns are the same when it comes to ride durations & the peak hours

2. Peak Hors & days patterns:

<img width="310" alt="Trips by hr by weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79733383/120586432-89275600-c401-11eb-892d-7dc1086b03ff.PNG">

The image above shows that the peak hours during weekdays are around the begining & end of office hours, which means that many users use the bikes for commutes & not just recreation. Peak hours in the weekdays are different, & distributed evenly over the day, but with a lower total number of rides than weekdays. This realization helps a lot with scheduling maintenance hours.

3. User type Analysis:

<img width="233" alt="Usertype" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79733383/120586798-2d110180-c402-11eb-94cf-21cf6f3af1b0.PNG">

The image above shows that the majority of riders are subscribers, rather than one-time customers, it also shows that subscribers have a more systemic usage with visible peak hours that are almost uniform,, versus the almost uniform usage of  customers.
## Summary
The visualizations made in this study show us that the project has a good potential in Des-Moines, due to the age distribution & the fact that most people have a relatively short commute to work (the average commute is 18mins). Which means that the drive to work can be replaced by a ride.

It also shows that we will need to make some effort in marketing the project among females as well as promoting long term subscriptions.

The study also gives us a clearer view of suitable maintenance hours & bike shifts, as well as hours with maximum numner of bikes needed.

More visualizations showing the separated age groups number of rides would give us more insights to the age demographics we need to target in our marketing campaigns.
